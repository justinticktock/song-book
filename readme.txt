Add worship songbooks to your site

== Description ==

Put worship into the hands of your church members.

Allow church groups to create and share worship song books on any devices (tablets, mobile phones..) and keep the worship song books up to date as new songs get used in church life.

'song book' uses the excellent [post-2-post](https://wordpress.org/plugins/posts-to-posts/) plugin by scribu, to create the association between songs and books.

It also helps faithful control and showing the organisation CCLI License number and show this while viewing the copyright song words.
The site should made private and for members only unless the songs are all in the public domain (e.g. when using for a Christmas Carol songbook )
